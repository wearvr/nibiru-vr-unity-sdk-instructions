# Requesting a development kit

If you meet any of the following criteria you are eligible to [request a Nibiru development kit](https://users.wearvr.com/developers/devices/nibiru/development-kit-request) from WEARVR:

* You have one or more VR experiences listed on WEARVR that you wish to port to Nibiru headsets.
* You wish to create a new VR experience for Nibiru headsets and have a strong portfolio of other apps on WEARVR.

If you are not eligible to request a development kit, you can still create a Nibiru experience and let WEARVR test your app for you. You can get in touch at `devs@wearvr.com` to discuss you circumstances.
