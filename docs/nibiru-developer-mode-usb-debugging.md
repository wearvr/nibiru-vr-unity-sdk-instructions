# Nibiru developer mode & USB debugging

Nibiru development kits are shipped with developer mode and USB debugging enabled by default. You do not need to change any settings before building to the device.

## Repositioning the device

Depending on how the Nibiru device is positioned when it is turned on, it may be oriented in a direction other than the one you wish. To reset the position, point the device straight ahead of you while maintaining a single focus point for more than a second. When the text Tap OK button to reposition appears, press the center button on the track pad.
